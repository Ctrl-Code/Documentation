>## PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

1. `grub-not-installing` - Most of the times we prefer to dual boot Linux over Windows such that the grub menu appears. But unfortunately this does not happen everytime as in my case. So solution to this problem is mentioned in the [link](https://github.com/Ctrl-Code/Documentation/tree/master/grub-not-installing).
