>## PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

* [grub-not-installing] - Most of the times we prefer to dual boot Linux over Windows such that the grub menu appears. But unfortunately this does not happen everytime as in my case. 

* [deleted-windows-bootloader-entry] - The probleum occured when I deleted windows bootloader entry and was unable to boot windows 10 OS.
